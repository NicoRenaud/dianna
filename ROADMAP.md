# Planned DIANNA developments

- Embeddings: We plan to add support for embeddings as a data modality around July 2022. This will allow users to create the same or similar explanations and visualizations for their models that is projecting data towards embedded spaces. We have plans how to do this conceptually, but suggestions on this are welcome.

- Add support for text for KernelSHAP XAI method (somewhere in 2022).

- Other data modalities: We plan to add support for timeseries, graphs and tabular data. Although we want to support all of these, we don't have expected delivery dates for them. 

- Dashboard: We plan to create a dashboard that combines output from various XAI methods into a single overview or interface. Ideas about this can be found in this issue: https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/issues/41

- Support for more XAI methods: LRP, PatternAttribution
